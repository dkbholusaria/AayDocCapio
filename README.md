## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkbholusaria/AayDocCapio.git
cd AayDocCapio
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
python app.py
```

> **Requires Google Chrome** for AIS/TIS downloads (the app launches real Chrome
> via `channel="chrome"`). 26AS works without it.
